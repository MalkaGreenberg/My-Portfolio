# My-Portfolio

## Description
This project is a portfolio of the deployed webpages that I have worked on so far.

## Installation
link to deployed application: https://malkagreenberg.github.io/My-Portfolio

## Usage
Each link in the header of the page takes you to the corresponding section on the page. 
when user clicks on an image it will open up that deployed project in a new tab.
when user clicks on a contact tab on the bottom of the page it selects the text to copy.

(The graphing calculator and shopping cart are both filler content. I connected a link to show that it works)
